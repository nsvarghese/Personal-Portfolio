					<h1><strong>Coding Progression</strong></h1>
		<article>
			<p>
				Welcome to my Coding Progression page!  As it states, this page will show how I have progressed in coding over the years.  You will read about my struggles, victories, accomplishments, and a list of tags I have learned (will update each year).
				<pre>
				</pre>
				Some struggles I had in this project were not getting my links to look right (they had bullet points next to them), my background not looking right as a saved image (an image saved on to my computer), my external CSS page (global.css), and having a lot of overlapping in my CSS (content repeated a lot).  Some victories/overcoming over struggles were getting my CSS styling to look right/professional, having clean code, and all of my web page content/paragraphs meeting requirements.  I have had a lot of accomplishments this year while coding, some of which are, huge leaps/milestones in styling, and not as many grammatical errors from last year.  As you can see in my screenshots, I had terrible clean code last year.  My styling was also mediocre.  But I grew a lot in those categories this year.  I am most proud of my styling because I have grown/learned the most in that area.  I have also learned a lot of Real World/21st Century Skills during this project.  Some include, problem solving, critical thinking, coding, analytical thinking, and thinking outside the box (more on coding growth in my STEM Foundations Portfolio Project page).
