		<h1>5 Qualities</h1>
		
		<h3><strong>Importance</strong></h3>
	<article>
		<p>
			The 5 Qualities are integral elements to our culture here at DRSS.  To succeed in Project Based Learning, students have to be familiar with and know how to apply the 5 Qualities.  Projects require groups, and groups require collaboration and communication; two of the Five Qualities. Inquiry assists students to keep on researching and learning a subject and help peers when they are struggling.  Creativity helps to think outside the box  or from a different perspective, or use a different method to achieve the goal.  Persistence is the driving force for all the qualities.  When group members are struggling, Persistence help you to use the other four qualities better and overcome the struggle.  Essentially, the 5 Qualities are vital for  PBL to be successful and meaningful.  Without the 5 Qualities, we students, would not be as good as some 21st Century skills we have instinctively learned here at DRSS.

		<h3>Persistence</h3>
	<article>
			<img src="images/persistence.jpg" height="192" width="192" class="img_style">
		<p>
			Persistence has many definitions and synonyms, but my experience with persistence has almost always been consistent.  To me, persistence is the ability to continue collaborating, continue communicating, inquire, etc. when we do not want to, are unmotivated, or simply tired.  For me, this tends to happen around the end of every quarter and especially at the end of 2nd and 3rd quarter.  I really have to tell myself that if I do not put a little effort now to persist that later I will have a lot more stress and work than I should have had.
		</p>

		<a id="Collaboration"></a>
		<h3>Collaboration</h3>
	<article>
			<img src="images/collaboration.jpg" height="192" width="192" class="img_style">
		<p>
			Collaboration is a very broad term used to describe multiple people working together to achieve a common goal.  The beauty of collaboration is that it is solely dependent on the people working together and feel different almost every time you do it.  For me, collaboration has been all over the chart depending on my group members, but I believe the best way to collaborate is to tailor your communication style depending on the people you are working with.  Keeping yourself and others accountable is vital and even though it may be uncomfortable, keeps the group together.

		<a id="Inquiry"></a>
		<h3>Inquiry</h3>
	<article>
			<img src="images/inquiry.jpg" height="192" width="192" class="img_style">
		<p>
			Inquiry, to me, is the opposite of persistence.  Inquiry requires interest, motivation, and a passion from the one going about it.  Inquiry is the opposite to bare minimum completion.  You are going above the requirements or base level tasks.  Inquiry should not take persistence as persistence is necessary for things one is not motivated to complete.  However, both are equally important and everyone should have subjects or topics they are passionate about and inquire in while also having others that they need to persist through.
		</p>		
	</article>
	
		<a id="Communication"></a>
		<h3>Communication</h3>
	<article>
			<img src="images/comunication.jpg" height="192" width="192" class="img_style">
		<p>
			Communication and collaboration go hand in hand, and without one, the other is simply not attainable.  Communication requires knowing the peer’s/partner’s learning style, and effectively tailoring your communication style to that individual person.  Sometimes this may be easier or harder depending on the group size, or people you are working with.  To get something accomplished, one needs to understand that their peers need to be encouraged and feel important so that they put their best effort into the product.  Once this skill is mastered, one can become an effective communicator and servant leader.

		<a id="Creativity"></a>	
		<h3>Creativity</h3>
	<article>
			<img src="images/creativity.jpg" height="192" width="192" class="img_style">
		<p>
			Creativity is the backbone to the other 4 qualities.  Though we may not always see it, we use different forms of creativity in our everyday lives.  We are taught problem solving and analytical thinking are essential to succeeding in the real world.  To master these skills, creativity is a vital component to understanding these skills as well.  Creativity fuels the qualities of communication and collaboration in the form of brainstorming.  Creativity can also deepen inquiry skills and persistence when you want to go about completing a boring or uninteresting project or activity in an unconventional way to keep yourself engaged.  Though creativity is not explicitly seen, it is always in the background, holding the 5 qualities together.
