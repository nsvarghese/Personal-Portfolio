						<h3>8th Grade Quality Growth</h3>
						<p>
							Throughout my 8TH Grade school year, I have used all of the 5 Qualities, but I feel I have grown the most in Persistence. This year we have had many more projects than we’ve ever had before. Most of the time I had multiple projects to work on at one time. Not to mention almost all our projects integrated different classes. One of the hardest projects for me this year was the Plate Tectonics Project (more on that on my Plate Tectonics Reflection Video). Since it was an engineering project, the project demanded acute craftsmanship, attention to detail, and good experience with power tools. Though we struggled at many times in this project, we were able to adapt quickly. The reason for this was we were very persistent and never wanted to give up, like when we measured parts wrong, or didn’t assemble pieces together properly. Another difficult project was the Club Website Project. In this project we had to create a website for a specific club to advertise to students. My group started out with four people. But by extraordinary chances, two of my group member left the school! So our group was spilt in half to only two people. Fortunately, we had all our planning and scheduling done early. But even still my partner and I found it difficult to persist to reach the goal of finishing the website because we had four different webpages to do with only two people. We were met with success at the end because of our persistent mindset. Without persistence, I wouldn’t have had a growth mindset through any of these projects. Persistence is the reason my grades are really good, without persistence, I wouldn’t be a successful student at the Dayton Regional STEM School.
