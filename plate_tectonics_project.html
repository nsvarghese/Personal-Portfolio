			<h1><strong>The Plate Tectonics Project</strong></h1>
			
			<article>
				<p>
					The Plate Tectonics Project was a project where we had to create a physical model on a plate boundary provided by a teacher.  Plate boundaries are boundaries where different tectonic plates collide (convergent boundary), slide past each other (transform boundary), or moving away from each other (divergent boundary).  Some examples are the Red Sea (divergent) and the Alpine Fault (transform boundary, the one we were assigned to).  The physical model we created had to be proportionate to the real one, so all the parts of the model had to be proportionate.  We created a small prototype and then created a final model twice its size.  The models were made out of hard and soft foam which were cut with bow cutters (a cutter to cut big pieces of foam), a table cutter (for small pieces of foam) and other power tools like a drill and dermal., covered in tape (tape colors represented parts of the earth, like red was the earth's mantle, and brown was elevated land), and a layer of packing tape on top (to keep it from getting dirty, tape peeling off and for a professional look).  Once we finished the models, they were transported to different schools in the area so students could learn about plate motion.
