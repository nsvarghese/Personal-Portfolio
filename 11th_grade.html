					<h3>Greatest Growth</h3>
			<article>
				<p>
					I believe my greatest growth my junior year of high school was persistence.  Now this is a quality that many people claim to grow in and it deemd cliche, however I strongly believe I am a more persistent learner/student now than I was at the beginning of junior year.  I can look back and see this in three major focuses of mine, both curricular and extra curricular.
					<pre>
					</pre>
					The first is the Stock Project completed in Financial Literacy.  Now in the practice round, I found myself almost dead last in the standing of our grade.  This was due to investing and selling simply at the wrong time and not due to my stock choices.  This I would learn only later.  However, in the project round, with a group of 3, I really told myself that I would not let myself fail again and used various methods to ensure my group's success in the project.  The main method I employed was finding IPO's (Initial Public Offerings) opening the week of our challenge.  These are new companies going public in their investments, and they usually exploded within minutes of the trading day's Start.  The trick was to buy at the beginning of the day, setting up a buy order, and then selling within the first few minutes when the share peaked.  We did this a few times with companies such as ATAKW, Aurora Technology Acquisition Corp. Warrants; ATAKR, Aurora Technology Acquisition Corp. Rights; and EMBCV, Embecta Corp. Common Stock When-Issued.  Though this was a success, we made most of our profits through buying, selling, and shorting ENSV, Enserveco Corporation, numerous times every day for several days.  We also invested in MULN, Mullen Automotive and ALLG, Allegro N.V..  At the end of the project, we placed sixth in the grade level in terms of gains (around 243k in profits) and placed second in the grade when adding our buffs and Lenin bucks.

					The second artifact illustrating persistence is the VEX Robotics unit we are currently on in Principles of Engineering.  At the beginning, we had many struggles getting our code to work; including the limit switch, and moving various sensors simultaneously using the loop function, curly brackets, and motor/sensor setup.  Our first struggle was setting up the limit switch to do what we wanted it to.  Our code was valid since when we compiled the program no errors appeared.  However, the code itself did not run.  We then had to ask a peer and he told us we had to bump switch code even though we had a limit switch code and did not have a bump switch.  Both essentially do the same thing and our code was "untilLimit" when it should have been "untiBump."  This was frustrating, but it was only the beginning.  A week later we had trouble finding the angles a potentiometer turned.  A potentiometer is supposed to turn a full 270 degrees but it takes values from 0-4095.  When we were calibrating it, we only got it to turn to 180 degrees.  This meant our values we entered, between 0-4095, weren't turning the full range of motion we wanted since we had measured wrong.  Lastly, just last week, we were trying to get the light sensor to trigger the motors to turn.  The code we wrote told the testbed to trigger the motors to start when the light sensor reached a value of 400 or less (the lower the number the darker, goes from 0-4095).  We also needed the motors to stop when the light sensor detected a value above 700, we planned on triggering this with a flashlight shined at the sensor.  The code for triggering the motors to stat worked, but for whatever reason the motors wouldn't turn off when the light sensor hit a value above 700.  We can see the values the sensors are outputting in the sensor debugger window.  We were baffled because we could see that the sensor was reading the right value, but wasn't triggering the motors.  Now we had many curly brackets in our code since those separate different lines of code.  It is sometimes hard to keep track of what bracket goes with its closing bracket and that was our mistake.  One of our brackets didn't have a closing one to accompany.  We added it and then it worked.  This reinforced a lesson we had learned back in 6th grade when learning to code with HTML and CSS.  Coding with VEX is similar to CSS.  Now the lesson is that the errors are usually really minor like missing semicolons or a closing tag.  These are difficult to spot since they are so miniscule.  Anyway, now we know to review each line of code after we type it to ensure we don't miss errors after writing many lines of code.

					My last artifact is an extracurricular that I took up in August of 2021.  I decided that I wanted to learn guitar.  Now this was because my church needed a guitarist ever since our former one went to piano since our pianist had left our church to another one.  I had experience with instruments before as I had played piano for six years and bass guitar for one.  This experience was valuable since I could already read music and knew many musical principles and terms that many new guitarists didn’t.  I was also extremely privileged to have an amazing instructor who is a naturally gifted guitarist but more importantly a very passionate and patient teacher.  Even with all this, I almost immediately hit setbacks.  Guitar strings are hard to press and my fingers weren't used to it, and it took weeks of dedicated practice just to build calluses.  I also had a hard time switching between different chords as I had to simultaneously move all my fingers into new positions to play another chord- all of this in between a singular strum!  As you can expect, this took weeks.  Weeks of me going from one note-a long pause-and then the next.  Now after a few months, I was able to switch between chords somewhat smoothly and have memorized most of the basic chords used in contemporary Christian.  Recently in the last few months, I have been learning how to play barre chords.  Now these are a whole different level of difficult because you have to turn your wrist to put your forefinger across all the strings in one fret.  You also have to turn your forefinger so that the bony side is against the strings so that they are pressed hard enough.  Now my wrist really hurt from doing this and my finger wasn't that strong so all my barre chords sounded horrible.  Not to mention seamlessly switching to them and off them were nearly impossible.  I still struggle with this now but there a are a few that I can switch to really quickly.  The main point is, if I had stopped all those months ago, I wouldn’t have been able to play guitar at church, which I do now and it's so much fun!  If I had quit anywhere along the way, I would nowhere be near to where I am right now.  I would have also been extremely disappointed and frustrated with myself.  My persistent mindset towards learning guitar, learning to code with VEX and be patient through the frustrating time I have with it, and pushing through in the stock project, really have shown me in retrospect that I am capable of succeeding when I really do put my mind into it.  Mindset is everything but accountability and discipline are almost as essential.  I believe that training this mindset will help me get a quick and early start into the college application process and figuring out what to do with my life after completing my high school education.
