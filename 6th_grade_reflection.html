				Since I have grown in the quality of Inquiry, I have improved in adding a lot of detail to my Adopt-an-Element(AAE) draft pictures & info page.  A struggle/challenge was that I had trouble drawing the image for my element(from the Periodic Table of Elements),Phosphorus because I could not draw the picture representing Phosphorus which was DNA because the image I copied from the Internet was very detailed and complicated.  I also had trouble writing a catchy slogan because I knew no words that rhymed with Phosphorus, because it was recommended that our slogan should rhyme.
				I overcame the challenge by making the last word of the first line of my slogan, an easy word I could rhyme which was "DNA."    The word I rhymed with 'DNA' was "hey."  I overcame the challenge of drawing the picture by changing it to a Phosphorus powder and copying and pasting it on my cover slide(I cited the image).  A success I  had was researching my element, because when I researched my element, all the info I needed was straightforward and easy to understand.  There were a lot of recommended websites, and I used them to find all my information in very little time.  I grew in this project by learning what atoms were, the elements are the simplest substances that make up everything in the universe, and about the element each of us were assigned to research.  Overall I became better at adding a lot detail, and becoming a better problem solver.
