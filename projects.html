			Our school, the Dayton Regional STEM School (DRSS) is very different from most schools.  But perhaps our biggest difference is our curriculum, PBL (Project Based Learning).  PBL basically means we learn material through projects and hands-on activities.  Basically, we learn material more thoroughly.  We also learn to solve Real-World Problems through projects.  We are different from other school because we can go as deep into a subject we want.  Our school is really different because we can go at our own pace.  We don’t learn through textbooks and worksheets and just believe whatever the teacher says instead of und\
			
			wodern skills we need today.  We learn collaborative skills which will help us in the Real World.   Also we students have voice and choice in what we do or how we do something.  We can also present our projects to the public.  For example, we made a Break-Out Box in 7th grade where we sent out our breakout box to the Dayton Main Branch Library.  We also use a Driving Question, which we have to answer through a project or hands-on activity. In 7th grade, we did (and continuing on till 12 grade) a Portfolio Project in STEM Foundations.  We are coding these portfolios with HTML/CSS, coding is a very vital 21st Century Skill we are learning.  We also learn to apply and implement what we learn.  We also learn how different subjects relate and work.  Most of our projects integrate  multiple classes.  For example, we did the Skin Color Project this year.  We learned in different classes, their view on how skin color affected people's lives.  Our school's goal is to: Prepare us to compete and collaborate in the Global Economy.  The school's motto is "The Real World Starts Here."  Our school really lives up to these standards.

			Also, in each Grade-Level page, you will find 2-3 highlighted projects, you will read about my struggles, victories, growth, and more in those projects.  Also in these projects you will see how much I’ve grown in 21st Century Skills.
