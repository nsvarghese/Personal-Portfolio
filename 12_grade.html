			<h2><strong>Greatest Growth</strong></h2>
				<article>
				<p>
					My greatest growth during my time at DRSS has been time management and persistence.  Middle school was a breeze and I really did not have to apply myself to succeed.  High school started out more or less the same but when COVID-19 hit and virtual/asychronous learning began, I saw the lack of self motivation and discipline I had as no one was around to keep me on track.  During this time, I had to employ a growth mindset and use my grades as motivation to keep me on track.  Below you will see some artifacts displaying my gradual growth of time managment and persistence.  Lockdown in a way, was a blessing in disguise as it really exposed my weaknesses and forced me to grow in areas I did not see before and now feel more ready to transistion smmothly into the independant study life of college.

					My first artifact are pictures of the kinds of things I would write in my agenda at the beginning of freshman year (off the heels of breezing through middle school) compared to a shellshocked veteran in the third quarter writing his homework in his agenda.  I noticed signigifacnt time mangament improvements after writing more due dates and test dates a week or two ahead as I could plan to study for a test or work on a project according to when it was due or occuring.

					My second artifact is a snapshot from my 10th grade portfolio reflection where I talked about the struggles of porcrastination through vritual learing.  This was one of the first major papers I had to write that year and I waited until the last minute to start and consequentially, underwent a lot of stress to turn it in on time.

					The stock challenge my junior year highlights persistence in a way I did not think would be possible.  I was dead last in the practice round and felt really discouraged going into the real simulation.  To prepare, I watched a bunch of videos and constantly watched different penny and volatile stocks to analayze which was the "safest" to make a lot of money.  I was able to succeed with the notes and concepts I researched and got 6th place in the final standings.

					VEX robotics my junior year highlights persistnece as I had a lot of trouble getting fluent with this programming language.  Through many youtube videos, experimentation, and labs I was able to become proficient enough to design a small robot with three ranges of motion for the final project.

					When I undertook guitar my junior year of high school, I spent a lot of time loathing my sore fingers and wrist trying to memorize all the common chords.  It got even worse when I got to barre chords, I strill struggle now, but looking back if I had not practiced those for as long as I had (6 months ago), I would be nowhere close to being able to play the few barre chords I can today.  This took a lot of mental discipline as there was not really anyone to get on me to practice this and mostly just self motivation to be able to play in the church band, which I do now!
