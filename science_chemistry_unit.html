			<h1><strong>Science Chemistry Unit</strong></h1>
			
			<article>
				<p>
					The Science Chemistry Unit is one Unit I really enjoyed learning and participating in.  The purpose of this project (or Driving Question, DQ), was: How chemical reaction work, & how we know they happened.  We learned about microscopic particles, atoms, molecules, pure substances, mixtures, chemical reactions, and more.  One of the things I enjoyed most was doing the experiments, if I hadn't done them before, I would be very curious to see what happened.  I also enjoyed watching documentaries, they were funny, informative, and entertaining.

				b. What I liked about this project were the documentaries & experiments.  They really strengthened my understanding of the material.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				c. If I had more time on this project, I would watch more documentaries to really reinforce what I was learning. 
				<br/>
				<br/>
				d. In this unit, we wrote many CERs (Claim, Evidence, & Reasoning)/Scientific Arguments.  CERs will help us in the Real World when we have to state an argument or prove something, like making a law.

					These tests below show my growth, they are the Chemistry Pre-Test (took before we started the unit to see what we knew) and the Post Test (took after the unit, this one was graded, unlike the Pre-Test, because we were expected to know all the material).  On the Pre-Test I didn’t do too well (since I didn’t know much).  But after the Unit, I got a 100% on the Post Test, because I learned everything thoroughly.
